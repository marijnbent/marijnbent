        A few times each year, I offer beginner-level blockchain courses, primarily aimed at professionals working in the banking sector. These two-day workshops are designed not only to explain blockchain technology clearly and understandably but also to provide practical, hands-on experience using the Ethereum blockchain and the Bitcoin testnet. However, over time I've noticed that the Bitcoin testnet has become increasingly challenging to use—its applications are often complicated to set up and lack clarity for beginners.

        Since Bitcoin remains an excellent tool for grasping fundamental blockchain concepts, I began searching for a simpler and more user-friendly alternative. I initially found a Bitcoin simulator online, but unfortunately, its codebase was quite outdated. Determined to provide a better learning experience, I spent a weekend building my own improved Bitcoin simulator.

        This new simulator supports multiple blockchains, making it ideal for group exercises or classroom settings. It allows users to visualize blocks clearly, mine new blocks, and add transactions easily. It even includes a built-in wallet feature for sending and receiving virtual Bitcoins. Additionally, the simulator handles blockchain forks elegantly by clearly displaying them and automatically invalidating transactions that are no longer part of the longest chain.
