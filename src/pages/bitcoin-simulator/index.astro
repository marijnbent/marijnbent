        I give beginner blockchain courses a few times a year, mostly for people working in banking. The workshops are two days and cover both theory and hands-on work with Ethereum and Bitcoin. The problem is that the Bitcoin testnet has become hard to use - the tooling is clunky and confusing for beginners.

        I found an existing Bitcoin simulator online but the code was outdated, so I built my own over a weekend.

        It supports multiple blockchains, which works well for group exercises. You can visualize blocks, mine new ones, add transactions and send/receive coins with a built-in wallet. It also handles forks by displaying them and invalidating transactions that fall off the longest chain.
