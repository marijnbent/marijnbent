        Hiredd is a self-hostable job application tracker I built for myself. If you've ever juggled multiple job applications across different companies, you know how quickly things get messy—different stages, interview dates, notes scattered everywhere. Hiredd brings it all together in one clean dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app is organized around workspaces, so you can separate different job searches (say, one for frontend roles and another for freelance projects). Within each workspace, you manage applications through a pipeline: from initial application to interviews, offers, and beyond. Each application tracks the company, role, current stage, and a full timeline of events and notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hiredd also includes a task and schedule view to keep track of upcoming interviews and to-dos, a profile section for your personal details, and a documents area to store resumes and cover letters. Everything is designed to be straightforward and fast—no unnecessary complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole thing is self-hostable with Docker. It's built with Astro SSR, React, Tailwind CSS, SQLite (via Drizzle ORM), and Better Auth for authentication. Just spin up the container, point your reverse proxy at it, and you're good to go. All your data stays on your own server.
