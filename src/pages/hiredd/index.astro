        Hiredd is a self-hostable job application tracker I built for myself. When you're applying to multiple companies at once, things get messy fast. Different stages, interview dates, notes all over the place. Hiredd keeps it all in one dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applications are organized in workspaces, so you can separate different job searches (one for frontend roles, another for freelance, etc.). Within a workspace, each application moves through a pipeline: applied, interviewing, offer and so on. You track the company, role, current stage and a full timeline of events and notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a task and schedule view for upcoming interviews and to-dos, a profile section for your details, and a documents area where you store resumes and cover letters. Nothing fancy, just the stuff you need to not lose track of things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Runs in Docker with Astro SSR, React, Tailwind, SQLite via Drizzle ORM and Better Auth. All data stays on your own server.
