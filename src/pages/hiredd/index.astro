        Hiredd is a self-hostable job application tracker. When you're applying to multiple companies at once, things get messy fast. Different stages, interview dates, notes all over the place. Hiredd keeps it in one dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applications are organized in workspaces, so you can separate different job searches. Within a workspace, each application moves through a pipeline: applied, interviewing, offer, etc. You track the company, role, stage and a timeline of events and notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a task and schedule view for upcoming interviews and to-dos, a profile section, and a documents area for resumes and cover letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Runs in Docker with Astro SSR, React, Tailwind, SQLite via Drizzle ORM and Better Auth. All data stays on your own server.
