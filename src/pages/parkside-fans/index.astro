        <a href="https://parkside.fans" class="text-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-foreground/80 transition-colors">parkside.fans</a> scrapes every European Lidl webshop and collects all Parkside products in one place. It shows price differences between countries at a glance and lets you spot new products as soon as they appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each product page shows which countries have it in stock, the current price per country and a price history that's updated three times a week. This makes it easy to tell real discounts from fake ones. For example, Lidl's Belgian and French shops are often up to 20% cheaper than Germany, which you'd never know without comparing.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can search by product name, filter by Parkside line (like Performance) and sort by newest additions. Useful if you're keeping an eye on a specific tool or just browsing what's new.
