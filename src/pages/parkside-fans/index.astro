        <a href="https://parkside.fans" class="text-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-foreground/80 transition-colors">parkside.fans</a> scrapes every European Lidl webshop and collects all Parkside products in one place. It shows price differences between countries and lets you spot new products early.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each product page shows which countries have it in stock, the current price per country and a price history updated three times a week. Lidl's Belgian and French shops are often up to 20% cheaper than Germany, which is easy to miss without a comparison tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can filter by product name or Parkside line (like Performance) and sort by newest additions.
