        If you're a big fan of Obsidian like I am, you probably enjoy how it lets you organize, link, and format your notes. But there's one thing that's always bugged me: there's no straightforward way to directly print your notes! Currently, you have to first export your notes as a PDF and then print them separately—definitely not the smooth, hassle-free experience we're aiming for.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's why I created <strong class="text-foreground font-semibold">Obsidian Print</strong>!
      </p>

      <p>
        This handy plugin simplifies the entire printing process, letting you go directly from your Obsidian workspace to a printed page in just one easy step. After installing Obsidian Print, you'll immediately have the option to print any note without ever leaving the app.
