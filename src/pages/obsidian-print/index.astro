      <p>
        Obsidian doesn't have a built-in way to print notes. You have to export to PDF first and then print that separately. It's a small thing but it gets old fast when you do it regularly.
      </p>

      <p>
        This plugin adds a print option directly in Obsidian. Select a note, hit print, done. No export step in between. It respects your note's formatting and works with most themes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Install it from the Obsidian community plugin store. Source is on <a href="https://github.com/marijnbent/obsidian-print" class="text-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-foreground/80 transition-colors">GitHub</a>.
