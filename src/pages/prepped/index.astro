      <p>
        Prepped is a self-hosted recipe app I built for my family. We kept bookmarking recipes across dozens of websites, most of them buried under ads and life stories. Prepped puts them all in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paste a URL and AI extracts the ingredients, steps and metadata. It converts to metric if needed. You can also paste plain text and it gets structured the same way. Servings scale in real time, and there's an AI chat per recipe for substitutions or technique questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a cook log to track when you made something, with photos, notes and ratings. Recipes can be organized with collections and tags. The interface is mobile-first since that's where you use it - in the kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        It supports English and Dutch, stores everything in a single SQLite file, and runs in Docker. Built with Astro, React, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth and Google Gemini. All data stays on your own server.
