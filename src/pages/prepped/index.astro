        Prepped is a self-hosted recipe app I built for my family. We kept bookmarking recipes across dozens of websites, most of them buried under ads and life stories. Prepped puts them all in one place, clean and always accessible.

      <p>
        Paste a URL and AI extracts the ingredients, steps and metadata. It converts everything to metric if needed. You can also paste plain text and it gets structured the same way. Once a recipe is in, you can adjust servings and all ingredients scale in real time. There's also an AI chat on every recipe page where you can ask about substitutions, technique or what to do when you're missing something.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a cook log to track when you made something, with photos, notes and ratings. Recipes are organized with collections and tags, and YouTube videos show up on the recipe page when available. The interface is mobile-first since that's where you use it most - standing in the kitchen with messy hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        It supports English and Dutch, stores everything in a single SQLite file (backup is just copying one folder), and runs in Docker. Built with Astro, React, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth and Google Gemini. No cloud dependencies, no subscriptions. All data stays on your own server.
